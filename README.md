# DCS

Just some stuff for DCS.

## Files
### materials.lua
This file allows you to use both of these two mods for the DCS F-16C Viper.

- [F-16C Block 50 Yellow MFD Overhaul](https://www.digitalcombatsimulator.com/en/files/3328823/)
- [F-16C HUD Improvement](https://www.digitalcombatsimulator.com/en/files/3328255/)

Just copy the file `materials.lua` into `C:\Program Files\Eagle Dynamics\DCS World OpenBeta\Mods\aircraft\F-16C\Cockpit\Scripts`, after you have installed those two mods.
